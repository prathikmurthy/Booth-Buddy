        sharing club and recruiter information without the need of paper flyers.

          Why Was BoothBuddy Created?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg w-[60%] mb-52">
          BoothBuddy aimed to solve two issues. One, the amount of paper flyers
          printed that are wasted and thrown away. Two, the lack of cell
          reception during the fair. BoothBuddy allows you to view all the
          information you need without the need of paper flyers.
